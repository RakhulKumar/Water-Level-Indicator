# Water-Level-Indicator using 74HC147 and CD4511

Most water level indicators for water tanks are based upon the number of LEDs that glow to indicate the corresponding level of water in the container. Here we present a digital version of the water level indicator. It uses a 7-segment display to show the water level in numeric form from 0 to 9.

The numeric water indicator circuit works off 5V regulated power supply. It is built around priority encoder IC 74HC147, BCD-to-7-segment decoder IC CD4511, 7-segment display LTS543 and a few discrete components.
